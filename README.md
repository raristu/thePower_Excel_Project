# üìä Sales analysis of Maven Roasters, a fictitious Coffee Shop operating out of three New York City locations.

## Description:

  In this project I will analyse an excel dataset which contains sales figures of a fictitious Coffe Shop located in NYC. The aim of this project is to answer questions such as:

    1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?
    2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?
    3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?

  I will use Microsoft Excel tools like pivot tables and formulas.

## Structure:

  This project contains the following files:

    1. README.md file: Project description
    2. Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx: raw data
    3. URL.txt: https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Coffee+Shop+Sales/Coffee+Shop+Sales.zip
    4. Coffe Shop Sales - Dashboard: Excel file in which I made all the transformations needed to develop the final Dashboard

## Installation and Requirements:

  All you need is Microsoft Excel installed on your laptop.

## üìä Results and Conclusions: 

The raw data file contains 11 columns with the following information:
   -  transaction_id: Unique sequential ID representing an individual transaction
   -  transaction_date: Date of the transaction (MM/DD/YY)
   -  transaction_time: Timestamp of the transaction (HH:MM:SS)
   -  transaction_qty: Quantity of items sold
   -  store_id: Unique ID of the coffee shop where the transaction took place
   -  store_location: Location of the coffee shop where the transaction took place
   -  product_id: Unique ID of the product sold
   -  unit_price: Retail price of the product sold
   -  product_category: Description of the product category
   -  product_type: Description of the product type
   -  product_detail: Description of the product detail


These are the main conclusions from the analysis:

  - ü•á Hell's Kitchen location is the store with bigger revenue.

  - Brewed Chai tea is always in the top 3 products in the three stores.

  - Transactions between 19:00 and 21:00 in the Lower Manhattan store are very low. Management could consider closing this store around 19:00 to reduce costs üí∏.
