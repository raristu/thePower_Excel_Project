# üìä Sales analysis of Maven Roasters, a fictitious Coffee Shop operating out of three New York City locations.

## Description:

  In this project I will analyse an excel dataset which contains sales figures of a fictitious Coffe Shop located in NYC. The aim of this project is to answer questions such as:

    1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?
    2. Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?
    3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?

  I will use Microsoft Excel tools like pivot tables and formulas.

## Structure:

  This project contains the following files:

    1. README.md file: Project description
    2. Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx: raw data
    3. URL.txt: https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Coffee+Shop+Sales/Coffee+Shop+Sales.zip
    4. Coffe Shop Sales - Dashboard: Excel file in which I made all the transformations needed to develop the final Dashboard

## Installation and Requirements:

  All you need is Microsoft Excel installed on your laptop.

## üìä Results and Conclusions: 

  - ü•á Hell's Kitchen location is the store with bigger revenue.

  - Transactions between 19:00 and 21:00 in the Lower Manhattan store are very low. Management could consider closing this store around 19:00 to reduce costs üí∏.
